# What I learned

## AI Concepts
- I learned the Q learning algorithm
- I learned you can train an AI on itself
- I learned in what ways classificaiton and reinforcement learning models differ
- I learned it is common to generalize and modify values such as individual weights or in this case, the q val based on the collective error.
